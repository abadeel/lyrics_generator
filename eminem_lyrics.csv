rap immortality like ι have got well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for

omnipotent let off then i am reloading immediately with these bombs i am toting and i should not be woken i am the walking dead but i am just a talking head a zombie floating but i got your mom deepthroating i am out my ramen noodle we have nothing in common poodle i am a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it is me my honestys brutal but it is honestly futile if i do not utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it is lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on i am back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ai not as big as i was but i am morphing into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i do not know what the fuck that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad cause fab said he looked

kill you lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assuming i am a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and i am devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfucking audience a feeling like it is levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they will be celebrating cause i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he is too mainstream well that is what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it is not hiphop it is pop—cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it is curtains i am inadvertently hurting you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at

tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i cannot batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then do not mistake him for satan it is a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard—be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god

dream to that he is deserted but i think it is working these verses are making him a wee bit nervous and he is too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he is heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurting him or ask if i am linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis cause they have been panning my album to death so i have been giving the media fingers do not wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they have been putting me through the ringer so i ai not ironing shit out with the press but i just took this beat to the cleaners

and see ya but i ai not here for your empathy i do not need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it is revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reached my full potential i peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked should not be that easy to do this you do not plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat caught your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans ironys spectacular huh now who is a faggot you punk and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it is just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it we are in the car right now – wait here comes my favorite lyric i am the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey heres a sequel to my mathers lp just

for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again part 2 produced by streetrunner i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i am the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i am your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it is hopeless i am the denial that you are hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it is over here we go all over again backs to the wall i am stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i am talking a lot of shit but i am backing it all up but in my head there is a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i am the ringing in your ears i am the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal chords after your concerts i am your time that is almost up that you have not acknowledged grab for some water but i am that pill that is too jagged to swallow i am the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult batter but the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers persona is half a facade and matthew and stangs just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it is gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i am the hindsight to say “i told you so” foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i am the future that is here to show you what happens tomorrow if you do not stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who cannot call it quits when it is time to walk away i am every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there is anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then do not bother so fore you rest your case better make sure you are packing a wallop so one last time i am back before it fades into black and it is all over behold the final chapter in a saga trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark as we pick up where the last mathers left off

33, step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers i am supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders i ai not never supposed to show it my crew ai not supposed to know it even if it means going toetotoe with a benzino it do not matter i never drag em in battles that i cannot handle less i absolutely have to i am supposed to set an example i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em if some shit ever does pop off i am supposed to be beside em that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it there is a certain line you just do not cross and he crossed it i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it i spent so much energy on it honestly i am exhausted and i am so caught in it that i almost feel i am the one who caused it this ai not what i am in hiphop for that is not why i got in it that was never my object for someone to get killed why would i wanna destroy something i helped build that was not my intentions my intentions were good i went through my whole career without ever mentioning and that was just outta respect for not running my mouth and talking about something that i knew nothing about plus dre told me stay out this just was not my beef so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while he is all over tv downtalking the man who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand this is business and this shit just is not none of my business but still knowing the shit could pop off at any minute cause— step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and would not have to worry about one of your people dying but now it is elevated cause once you put someones kids in it the shit gets escalated — it ai not just words no more is it it is a different ballgame you call names and you ai not just rapping we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happening me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him and asked him not to start it he was not gonna go after him until ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it meanwhile my attentiongs pulled in another direction some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk has an erection for me and thinks that i will be his resurrection tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record but now he is fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up was through that publication the same one that made me famous now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then but i am so busy being pissed off i do not stop to think that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc and he is inherited mine which is fine ai not like either of us mind but we still have soldiers that is on the front line who is willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders never to extort us strictly to show they support us and maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show em we love em back and let em know how important it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is but i ai not tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered it ai not worth it i cannot think of a perfecter way to word it than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict i will walk away from it all fore i let it go any further but do not get it twisted it is not a plea that i am copping i am just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit popping off at the jaws well then i can cause frankly i am sick of talking i am not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause— step by step heart to heart left right left we all fall down like toy soldiers bit by bit torn apart we never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
34, feels like a close it is coming to fuck am i gonna do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called “hi my name is” dropped started thinking my name was fault cause any time things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dog gangster nah courageous balls had to change my style they said i am way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that i went against it it was ingrained in me that i would not amount to a shit stain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i do not wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form i was raised upon but sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep plugging it is your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah feel like i have already said this a kabillion 80 times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really wanna say is if there is anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to— i was a… afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i would never be found i did not wanna go another round an angry mangs power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is near guts over fear might shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round i let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear feels like a close it is coming to fuck am i gonna do it is too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know i know what it was like i was there once single parents hate your appearance as you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it was not until i put the pain in song learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit harder shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park and the window is closing and there is nowhere else that i can go with flows and i am frozen cause there is no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but i rather make “not afraid 2” than make another motherfucking “we made you” ah now i do not wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that will make you strong enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i cannot explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my dang self when on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma cause that gave me the strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium least i made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song and everything you are scared to say do not be afraid to say no more from this day forward just let them aholes talk take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blond lives on through you when i am gone and to think i was a— i was a… afraid to make a single sound afraid i would never find a way out out out afraid i would never be found i did not wanna go another round an angry mangs power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love run out of excuses for everyone so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is near guts over fear might shed a tear for all the times i let you push me round i let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear

could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling women dishing but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him guess i am a little bit of a hypocrite when i am ripping shit but since when did this many people ever give a shit what i had to say it is just my opinion if it contradicts how i am living put a dick in your rear end that is why every time you mentioned a lyric i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform i am flattered you thought i was that important but you cannot ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed attaboy they told me to slow down i would just zone out good luck trying to convince a blonde it is like telling gwen stefani she sold out cause i was tryna leave no doubt in anyones mind one day i would go down in history think they know now because everybody knows everybody knows that you are just an asshole everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows everybody knows so do not pretend to be nice there is no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows everyone knows thanks for the support

not compete with nobody i just go hard do the ropeadope ali shuffle and dance around my opponents do donuts sometimes i play possum like i am asleep it is awesome i am like a sleeping giant and when i awake i am like dre i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey and sink my teeth in em and fill em full of poison and make a noise like a snake before i kill em and let em know that i just do not feel em and smack em with the backward e the eminem emblem i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him tell him why look him dead in the eye then waste him and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls for this rap game and it gggoes onetwothree chkchk onetwothree
